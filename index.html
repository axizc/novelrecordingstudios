      <h1> Song 1</h1>
A piece that represents Section 1 is called “Prelude in C# Minor Op. 3, No. 2”. It is by the composer Sergei Rachmaninov. This piece starts off with the 3 note motif that is recurring throughout the piece. These repeating melodies signify despair and build-up agitation, just like how Darya “Dolly” Alexandrovna felt when she discovered her husband cheated on her with their children’s governess. Her husband, Stiva, was known to be a kind and good-natured man, and people still viewed him so even after he cheated on his wife. Frankly, he didn’t understand why it was wrong, and told himself that he was simply “following his heart”. Following the news, Dolly shut herself in her room, threw fits, and became extremely upset. She was all alone, and her hidden sorrow is exactly what this song represents. From 0:00 to 0:36, the piano melody is that of spiraling despair, a wave of indescribable emotions. The news of Stiva’s infidelity has just been received and it is slowly starting to sink in. Then at 1:44, the 3 note motif gets faster and faster. The tension is building up, and there should be an explosion of some sort. However, this never happens in the piece. Instead of a loud ending, the piece ends right where it started, back to the 3 notes of helplessness. Despite the anger in some parts of this piece, it still carries the weight of immense sadness, and each note is left with a sorrowful aftertaste. Though Dolly was terribly angry at her husband, the underlying emotion behind was irreversible sorrow. Ultimately, her extreme anger led her back to the sorrow she felt when hearing about it for the first time.<p></p>&#13;

      <h1> Song 2</h1>
The piece “Liebestraume“ by Franz Liszt is German for “Dreams of Love”. This piece is scarily accurate to the premise of Section 2. Anna is just beginning to notice Count Vronsky. He follows her to his hometown ignoring his betrothed, Ekaterina (Kitty). Vronsky is enchanted with Anna’s beauty, and after pursuing her, Anna begins to develop feelings for Vronsky as well. Because she is already married, her “dull” husband warns her about her close relationship with Vronsky. Anna, however, is madly in love and sees the world with rose tinted glasses. Liebestraume brings about the image of two young people happily in love. While there is a slight undertone of a minor melody in this piece, it almost presents itself with the conviction that love is blind. In Anna’s situation, her new lover, Vronsky, seems like the perfect man, while her husband seems boring and emotionless. This may have been true, but it could more likely be a warped perception that Anna has because of love. One quote from section 2 that heavily pertains to “Liebestraume” is, “She dreamed that both were her husbands at once, that both were lavishing caresses on her.” Anna was at a point in her life, where she did not yet understand the consequences of infidelity. To her, it was a problem that she would have to worry about later. Liebestraume also remains in the same key signature throughout, which is a stark contrast to most other classical pieces of music. Most other pieces change to a different key signature to signify development, but Liebestraume's lack of a change may suggest the belief that love is never-ending. Anna never ceased to be in love with Vronsky, even in the later sections.

  <h1> Song 3</h1>
Shostakovich’s 15th Symphony is the pinnacle of anxiety. The haunting violin melodies, the dissonance, and the rumble of the low bass all bring together a piece that represents Section 3 of “Anna Karenina”. After the initial rosy colored period, Anna now realizes that her choices, in fact, do have consequences. While she doesn’t care for Karenin, she dearly loves her son. Karenin has grown anxious as well. He doesn’t care for his wife either, but he fears that his reputation and job will be at stake. Both of these characters are plagued by their anxieties and fail to reach a conclusion or compromise regarding their qualms. The 3rd movement of Shostakovich’s 15th symphony ends unresolved, suggesting that anxiety never fully goes away, Anna, who has now been found out by Karenin must find a way to keep visiting her son while getting to see Vronsky as well. The strange chromatic runs in the 15th symphony seem to represent Karenin’s feelings about the situation with Anna. While he never truly loved his wife, he feels uncertain about her relationship with Vronsky. The quote “He experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache.” signifies the lack of emotions in Karenin, but also characterizes him as a human who has emotion. While he may not have a wide range, anxiety is something that Karenin seems to feel deeply.

      <h1> Song 4</h1>
Konstantin Levin, who is one of the main protagonists, has faced many ups and downs in the novel so far. He gets rejected by Kitty, who is the love of his life and moves to the countryside in despair. In Section 4, Levin begins to see some hope in his life. While Anna starts off happy before spiraling, Levin experiences rejection firsthand before experiencing something more favorable. This suggests that Levin’s and Anna’s futures will be extremely different from one another. The piece “Piano Concerto in D minor” by Rachmaninoff represents the transition in Levin’s life. The piano concerto is around 40 minutes long and is a notoriously difficult piece for piano players. It starts off in a depressive state, as is the quality of D minor. At around 30:02, the pace starts to pick up and the piece transitions from D minor to D major. The transformation of the key signatures is very subtle and doesn’t happen very quickly. Levin and Kitty were previously simply acquainted with each other. It took a while for Kitty to start “loving” Levin. Meanwhile, characters like Anna and Vronsky had an immediate infatuation with each other. This is very telling about future events in the book.

      <h1> Song 5</h1>
Alexey Karenin underwent major character development during Section 4. Previously, every move Anna had made agitated him, but after seeing her fall deathly ill, he canceled the divorce and even allowed her back home. He claims to have achieved serenity after seeing Anna on her deathbed. The piece by Debussy, “La fille aux cheveux de lin”, uses silence in between the notes and a slow place to convey a sense of peace and calm. Debussy was a pioneer of the Impressionist style of music and was highly skilled at representing scenes in nature through music. Nature is usually tranquil, yet there are moments when it can be wild and uncontrollable. Alexey Karenin has a methodical way of dealing with his problems, just like how nature does its best to deal with human interference. However, Karenin does have lapses of judgment, especially in matters concerning Anna. At around 1:46, a note in the forte dynamic is introduced in the music. It could signify a sudden change in ideas, or enlightenment like Karenin had.

    <h1>Song 6</h1>
In Section 5, Levin and Kitty get married. Their marriage is uncharacteristic for a couple in the 1900s, neither cared about money or social status. Kitty was even deemed ugly by many of the snobbish ladies, and Levin ran to his wedding after frantically trying to look for a shirt. Other than these small details, their marriage was one of love, or at least what the author portrays love as. Unlike Dolly and Stiva or Anna and Karenin, Levin’s marriage is foreshadowed to go smoothly. The piece, “Marriage D’amour”, by Chopin means “Marriage of Love”. This beautiful piece conveys the many emotions one feels before getting married. Just before their marriage, Levin asked Kitty if he was really worthy of her. The piece initially starts off uncertain, almost hesitant, similar to how Levin felt about marriage. After the initial period of confusion, the melody is resolved nicely and begins to show joy and excitement. During the wedding, Levin started crying, which was unlike most grooms at the time. The emotions Levin feels in “Anna Karenina” are a lot deeper than other characters. He seems to have a very strong sense of morals, and his emotions are regularly influenced by how he follows these morals. Something interesting about “Marriage D’amour” is that it is written in a minor key. Most songs about Marriage are either sentimental or grandiose, but “Marriage D’amour” strikes me as bittersweet. The bittersweet feeling of marriage is a central theme of Anna Karenina.

    <h1>Song 7</h1>
	Anna’s meeting with her son is one of happiness, guilt, and sorrow. She feels guilty for leaving her precious son for Vronsky but despises her husband too much. In the latter half of Section 5, Anna buys gifts for her son carefully. While this appears to have no significance to the story, it shows the final parting between Anna and her son. One of my favorite pieces by Chopin is the “Waltz in C-Sharp Minor op 64 No 2”. It effortlessly conveys the feelings Anna has towards her son. The beginning melody shows a minor melody with major undertones, before fully merging into the beautiful melody of C# minor. Any happy memory Anna ever had with her son is immediately overshadowed by the guilt she feels for abandoning him. An interesting note about this piece is that while Chopin usually ends his “sad” pieces with happy endings, this piece doesn’t receive a happy ending. It simply repeats the recurring theme over and over again, exemplifying the effect Seryozha has on Anna’s despair. The lack of a proper ending also suggests that Anna and Seryozha’s relationship is never fixed. Despite Anna preparing for the final parting between her and her son, she does not get to give him the toys that she “lovingly” picked out for him. While the toys have no real impact on what Seryozha thinks of Anna, the guilt she feels for not being a part of her son’s life overshadows this.

    <h1>Song 8</h1>
In Section 6, Anna meets Dolly again, and their conversation does not go as planned, The third movement of “Appassionata” by Beethoven really symbolizes how Anna’s life starts to go down. The pure confusion, anger, and agitation in this selection are heavy foreshadowing on Anna’s part. While Dolly supports Anna, even in her affair, she does not like Count Vronsky. He strikes her as arrogant. Dolly, who is usually a calm and serene person, decides to make haste and leave early after talking with Vronsky and seeing Anna’s disregard for her baby. The 3rd movement of “Appassionata” is in a particularly fast tempo, and even has recurring 16th notes. Anger is usually an emotion that is expressed on a whim, though it can be built up over time. Dolly’s momentary anger towards Anna and Vronsky is on a whim, as she still never had a bad opinion of Anna. However, seeing Anna treat her daughter carelessly strikes a nerve in Dolly. At the beginning of the book, Anna begs Dolly not to divorce Stiva because of their children. Dolly also regarded her children as a very significant part of her life, and seeing Anna not treat her children the same irks her. “Appassionata” has a beautiful melody, regardless of the intensity and anger it possesses.

    <h1>Song 9</h1>
Realistic novels have neither pure good nor pure bad characters. Leo Tolstoy dives into the personalities of many characters without having any Mary Sue characters. Anna in particular is a great example of this. Anna is someone who is shown to be both elegant, but scandalous, beautiful but jealous, and energetic but sorrowful. In the 7th Section of “Anna Karenina”, her life takes a turn for the worse, as her sadness and depression only get worse. The piece, “Ballade in F minor”, by Chopin gorgeously represents this. The Ballade in F minor not only represents Section 7 but also Anna’s whole life. According to Western Michigan University, the key of F minor is known for being “Deep depression, funereal lament, groans of misery and longing for the grave” As Anna’s jealousy over Vronsky's perceived coldness and paranoia about his love increases, she no longer has a reason to live, She abandoned her husband, son, and societal status all for a man whom she believed no longer loved her. However, from an outsider’s perspective, Vronsky still treated Anna dearly, and it may have been her own paranoia that caused her to jump under the train tracks.  “Ballade in F minor” starts off very calmly yet depressive, and slowly increases in intensity throughout the piece. There are constant periods of slight happiness before devolving into a more intense melody and rhythm that occur all throughout the piece. These mood changes are reminiscent of how Anna perceives Vronsky. Every small detail, and every small action, from the attitude in his eyes, can send Anna spiraling.

    <h1>Song 10</h1>
In the final section of “Anna Karenina”, there is not a single mention of Anna. It is almost as though the author wants readers to forget about her existence. Instead, the 8th section of the novel focuses on Levin and Kitty, as they were the only arguably successful marriage in the entire book. Through a short, but sweet ending, Anna’s character seems to be long forgotten. Perhaps the societal implications of her behavior had rendered even her close friends and relatives unable to mourn her loss. A piece that represents this section is “Chasse Neige” by Franz Liszt, meaning “Snow Plow” in French. This piece is the last of 12 etudes that Franz Liszt composed. The repeating trills and chromatic runs throughout the piece effectively represent a snowstorm. “Anna Karenina” follows the story of many different characters. Some of them failed to cross the snowstorm that is life, and others were more successful. Chasse-Neige, being one of my favorite pieces, is one of Franz Liszt's most thoughtful compositions, and its music can be interpreted in many ways.
